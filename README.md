# QuirkyShop

This is my first school assignment where I implement all the tools I've learned from my first two months on Nackademin.
I get to fetch data from an API and render the information on an HTML site by appending them to a parent. I also work a bit with
classes to create a user based web shop where information is stored based on the user.

This project is more of a log of my progression, but if you're interested to try it you can download the ZIP-file and open the html
file from there.

I think this assignment has been very rewarding and I feel that I've learned a lot by doing it. this really feels like a checkpoint
in my evolution to become a successful developer.

I want to give a special thanks to my professor @hassanmian
